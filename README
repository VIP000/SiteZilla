This is a development version and does not currently work. For a working version please download v0.01 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sitezilla/files/
I'm busy sorting through the code and converting it to OO PHP. The new file structure will be as follows:

ImageManager/ --> ckeditor's image manager
ckeditor/ --> ckeditor
content/ --> content uploaded by generated sites like custom images
inc/ --> SiteZilla functions and classes
js/ --> all JavaScript used in SiteZilla
pages/ --> all SiteZilla's page content like the index page
templates/ --> templates (themes) used by SiteZilla for the generated websites
themes/ --> the themes for SiteZilla's front end
translations/ --> translations for SiteZilla's front end (please do not translate anything yet)
webtypes/ --> this folder contains all the plugins. each plugin is for a type of website that SiteZilla can create (eg, Static_HTML, Blog, Shopping)

The other folders contains the current code that I'm currently moving and converting. If you would like to contribute or help move code please do it in the folders mentioned above.
Any help would be welcomed.

========================================================
ABOUT SITEZILLA
========================================================

SiteZilla is an Open Source Web Based Website Builder. It is not a CMS system and SiteZilla is used to create websites. Just like you would not install DreamWeaver on your hosting account to create your website, you won't install SiteZilla on your hosting account to use as a CMS. SiteZilla is intended for users who create a lot of websites or hosting companies who want to give their clients a way to easily build their own websites.

The main SiteZilla website can be found at http://www.sitezilla.co.za
To download the latest version of SiteZilla go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/sitezilla/files/
For howto's and tutorials go to http://sourceforge.net/p/sitezilla/wiki/Home/
For bug reports, support and help go to the forums at http://sourceforge.net/p/sitezilla/discussion/
For the latest news go to http://sourceforge.net/p/sitezilla/blog/

If you find any code that I'm not allowed to use in SiteZilla please let me know. SiteZilla is released under the GPLv3 and as far as I know the code used from other sources are allowed here.

========================================================
REQUIREMENTS
========================================================

A Linux machine with LAMP installed. Only PHP 5.x are supported.

========================================================
HOW TO INSTALL
========================================================

0.) Extract all the files to your web folder. (example - /home/sitezilla/public_html/)

1.) Edit ImageManager/php/config.php and edit.

	$config["base_url"]= 'http://www.yourdomain.com/content/'.$siteid.'/files';
	$config["upload_path"]= '/full_path_to_sitezilla_folder/content/'.$siteid.'/files';

2.) Edit functions/config.php and place all the correct values there where needed.

3.) Create a MySQL Database and import the sql file in sql/sitezilla.sql

4.) Edit the database name, username and password in functions/dbconfig.php

5.) The default usernames and passwords for SiteZilla are:

SiteZilla Admin:
	Username: admin
	Password: sitezilla

SiteZilla User:
	Username: user
	Password: user

SiteZilla Developer:
	Username: developer
	Password: developer

6.) Remove the sql/ folder

========================================================
EDITING CONTENT
========================================================

All the SiteZilla website content is stored in pages/*.php
The main SiteZilla template is stored in admin_template/*
To add/remove links to the SiteZilla menu edit functions/functions.php around line 460

========================================================
ADDING AND USING TEMPLATES
========================================================

The templates used in SiteZilla are all released under an open source license that allows them to be included in SiteZilla. Please to not remove the Author links that are automatically generated by SiteZilla as this would be against almost all of the licenses under witch the templates are made available. If you find any template that is not suppose to be included in SiteZilla please contact me and I will remove it ASAP. To see how templates are created take a look at the Website Help page in the Help menu. All templates goes into the templates/ folder.

========================================================
BUILDING WEBSITES
========================================================

Creating websites is very easy with SiteZilla. Help is enabled by default so just hold your mouse over the little help icons and you will see what to do. Once you have completed your website you will be able to download it from the page where all your websites are listed. Just click on the download icon and save the site to your computer.

Note: Deleted websites are moved to the admin's account so only admin can truly delete a website. One issue is that folders where the images for generated websites are stored (content/XX/) are not being deleted when the admin deletes a website.

========================================================
THE ROAD AHEAD
========================================================

If you add templates to SiteZilla please consider sending them to me so I can include it in the template pack. Please make sure that the templates are licensed to be included and used in SiteZilla.

I've created SiteZilla while learning PHP and thus the coding style you'll find in the code. I welcome any suggestions that you have or material that I should read. SiteZilla is a website building tool and will be kept as that. It will never be turned into a CMS like Drupal or Joomla. Many website users find popular CMS system too bloated for simple websites. In the future SiteZilla might be able to produce a CMS system with only the needed modules that you could then upload to your hosting account. This is a list of things that I'd like to still do:

1. Convert all the code to OOP
2. Create a "plugin" type of system for the types of websites so one can just create a new "plugin" for a shopping or blog website for example. The current HTML website creating code will have to move into a plugin itself.
3. Add an option to directly upload the generated website to your hosting account either via FTP (if SiteZilla is on a different server) or by copying the produced website to the correct domain's folder (if SiteZilla is installed on a shared hosting account)
4. I'm not sure about this one but it could be handy to be able to disable the registration functions and pull the user data from WHMCS. It will enable hosting companies that can't afford expensive web builders to give their clients an easy way to create their sites. If SiteZilla is setup this way it should disable the option of adding websites and pull the data from the WHMCS database for each hosting account that the client has.
5. Fix/change the way some things are done in SiteZilla
6. Add a template system like Smarty to SiteZilla itself so hosting companies can customize it to their needs
7. Add more templates for websites to use (that would be very nice).

If you have any suggestions or ideas please share them. It would be supper awesome if some of the PHP coders out there could help me make this the best web based website builder available. :D

If you find SiteZilla useful and it brings a big smile to your face please consider making a small donation via PayPal on www.sitezilla.co.za. It will provide me with more time to donate to SiteZilla and reduce the time I spend doing other, not so fun, paying jobs.
